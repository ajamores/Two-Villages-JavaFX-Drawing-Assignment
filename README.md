# Two Villages JavaFX Drawing Assignment

This is a JavaFX drawing program that creates two villages, each with three houses. The houses are randomly sized and positioned, and each house contains one window and a door. The program also includes a king's house.

The TwoVillages class creates the framework for all the JavaFX components and creates the instances of each village and the king's home. The villages are drawn with different colors and sizes, and the king's house is positioned on the right side of the canvas.

This program was created as an assignment for a Java programming course, and it demonstrates the use of JavaFX graphics and image manipulation. The code can be modified and improved upon for further development of JavaFX applications.
